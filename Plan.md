# Project Plan: Digital Learning Platform for Nabha

## Phase 1: Planning & Content Creation

* **1. Finalize Curriculum:**
    * Map out the **PSEB (Punjab School Education Board)** curriculum for target grades (e.g., 6th-10th).
    * List the specific subjects: **Math, Science, English, Punjabi, Social Studies**.

* **2. Develop Lesson Content:**
    * Create **interactive lessons** for each topic (e.g., videos, quizzes, animations).
    * Ensure all content is available in both **Punjabi and English**.
    * Keep lessons short, focused, and downloadable for offline use.

* **3. Create Digital Literacy Modules:**
    * Develop simple, step-by-step guides on:
        * **Internet Safety:** Passwords, identifying scams, privacy.
        * **Using a Smartphone/Computer:** Basics of files, folders, and settings.
        * **Basic Typing:** In both English and Punjabi.
        * **Searching for Information:** Using Google effectively.

* **4. Design the User Experience (UX/UI):**
    * Sketch out simple, clean screens for the app.
    * Design for users with **low digital literacy**. Use large buttons, clear icons, and minimal text.

## Phase 2: Technical Development

* **5. Choose Your Technology Stack:**
    * **App:** React Native or Flutter (to build for both Android & iOS from one codebase).
    * **Backend:** Node.js or Python (for managing data and users).
    * **Database:** Firebase (excellent for its built-in offline sync capabilities) or a standard SQL database like PostgreSQL.

* **6. Build the Student App:**
    * Code the user login/signup.
    * Implement the lesson viewer and interactive quizzes.
    * **Crucial:** Integrate **offline mode**. All lessons and progress must be saved on the device and sync with the server when a connection is available.

* **7. Develop the Teacher Dashboard:**
    * Create a web-based portal for teachers.
    * Implement features to **track student progress**, view quiz scores, and see which lessons have been completed by their class.

* **8. Optimize for Performance:**
    * Compress all videos, images, and lesson data to keep the app's size small.
    * Write efficient code that runs smoothly on low-end, affordable smartphones.

## Phase 3: Testing & Deployment

* **9. Conduct Thorough Testing:**
    * Test all app features on actual **low-end devices**, not just simulators.
    * Specifically test the offline functionality and data synchronization process.
    * Fix bugs and address any performance issues.

* **10. Run a Pilot Program:**
    * Partner with one or two schools in the Nabha area.
    * Onboard a small, controlled group of students and teachers to use the app.

* **11. Gather Feedback:**
    * Collect direct feedback from the pilot users. Ask them what is working, what is confusing, and what features they wish they had.
    * Use surveys and direct interviews to understand their experience.

* **12. Iterate and Launch:**
    * Use the feedback to make final improvements to the app.
    * Plan for a wider launch in more schools based on the success of the pilot.
